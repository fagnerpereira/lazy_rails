# LazyRails

LazyRails simplifies Rails project creation and tool installation, addressing two common pain points:

1. Simplifying the verbose command for creating new Rails apps.
2. Customizing the default tools installed with a new Rails project.

## Features

- Interactive guide for creating new Rails projects
- On-the-fly addition and installation of popular gems and tools. No more open documentation and copy-paste commands.

## Installation


Install globally:
```bash
gem install lazy_rails
```

## Usage

Create a new Rails project:
```bash
lazy_rails new
```

2. Install dependencies: `bin/setup`

4. Start console: `bin/console`

Local installation: `bundle exec rake install`
